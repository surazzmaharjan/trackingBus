Bus Tracking Application

#Introduction :

The prototype application will have two sides i.e driver and passenger where both geolocation data will be sent to the database.
Passengers can find the nearest public bus, track it and get the estimated arrival time with the distance between them. They can send requests
to the driver to wait for them, and view the bus status. Driver can also find all the passengers nearby and respond to the passengers 
if they are requested to wait. They also can update the bus status. For example: if they are stuck in traffic jams for hours then
status will be stuck in traffic jams, if  the bus is full of passengers then status will be fully occupied etc.
